# ChromeTabEventTriggers
Fire off a web request when certain tabs are open or closed. 

Currently used to turn on an elgato light when google meet opens/closes.

Load 'unpacked extension' in the Google Chrome extensions manger to use. Change the ip address and temp/brightness preferences to match what you want.

Warning:
Host permissions are fully open in the manifest file. This is fine, as is, but just an FYI.
